<h1>The Best Movies According to James</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h3>

<p>A profound, quietly powerful story about hope, resilience, and human dignity. The film follows Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongfully imprisoned, and his unlikely friendship with Red. 
    What makes it timeless is its emotional payoff — a masterclass in slow-burn storytelling, character development, and catharsis. 
    It’s one of the rare films that gets better with every rewatch, reminding you that hope is not naïve — it’s necessary.</p>

<h3>Inception (2010)</h3>

<p>A mind-bending sci-fi thriller that blends spectacle with emotional depth. Christopher Nolan crafts a multi-layered dream heist that’s as intellectually stimulating as it is 
    visually stunning. Beyond the iconic action set pieces (the spinning hallway, folding city), it’s ultimately a story about grief, guilt, and letting go. The final scene’s 
    spinning top remains one of the most debated endings in cinema history.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>

<p>More than a superhero movie — it’s a psychological crime epic. Heath Ledger’s Joker redefined villainy with an anarchic brilliance that still sends chills. 
    The film explores chaos vs. order, moral ambiguity, and the cost of heroism, all wrapped in intense action and unforgettable dialogue. It set a new standard for blockbuster 
    storytelling and character-driven drama.</p>
